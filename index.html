I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Geography, National University of Singapore beofre joining HKUST(GZ). My research focuses on urban governance, environmental politics, and the geopolitics of China‚Äôs international pursuit, notably the Belt and Road Initiative. With cases near and beyond China‚Äôs border, I enquire about the power entanglements of state and non-state actors in shaping discourses, producing knowledge, and regulating the implementation of international infrastructure projects and cooperation mechanisms. I try to weave domestic and extraterritorial issues to seek cross-scale explanations for the conflicts, dilemmas, and variations. My internship experiences at both governmental and non-profit agencies in China and Southeast Asia grant me the chance to observe their operation and contact potential informants. I have been publishing in Chinese and English geography journals, such as Annals of the AAG, Dialogues in Human Geography, Geoforum, Economic Geography(ÁªèÊµéÂú∞ÁêÜ), etc.</p> <p>I am now establishing a Politics and Governance of Sustainable Cities lab (PGSC). The vision is to examine the sustainable development and transformation processes of global cities in addressing climate and environmental challenges, by combining quantitative analysis with qualitative case studies. This approach aims to explore the forces and obstacles at various scales, including domestic and international, and from different dimensions such as social and political, that global cities face during their development and transformation. The goal is to seek experiences and viable paths for sustainable urban development construction and transformation governance for countries in the Global South.</p> <p>The lab is recruiting PhD students and Research Assistants.

These members of Chinese civil society are playing an increasingly important role in the environmental governance of the country‚Äôs overseas activities. By analyzing firsthand observations and interviews and secondhand materials produced by NGOs and the Chinese government, this article traces how and why Chinese NGOs seek to ‚Äúgreen‚Äù China‚Äôs engagement beyond its borders. First, we identify four types of Chinese NGOs with a variety of state- and non-state founders. Then, we examine how NGOs‚Äô objectives and state policies jointly shape the way they ‚Äúgo out.‚Äù As both knowledge and political actors, Chinese NGOs accumulate, produce, and disseminate knowledge related to Global China‚Äôs environmental issues, across domestic and international spaces. Though the specific strategies pursued by NGOs depend on their type, overall, their alignment with Chinese state policies and interests constitutes a crucial condition for their success. This research offers new insights into Chinese non-state actors‚Äô expanding participation in international activities. As the country‚Äôs civil organizations endeavor to exert influence both within and beyond China‚Äôs borders, the effects of their interventions on global governance may grow.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Liu2023AAG" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Governing the Extraterritorial: Global Environmentalities of China‚Äôs Green Belt and Road Initiative</div> <div class="author"> <em>Liu, Xiaofeng</em>,¬†and Bennett, Mia M. </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Annals of the American Association of Geographers</em> 2024 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2023.2249081" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This article proposes a global environmentality framework to critique efforts to ‚Äúgreen‚Äù the Belt and Road Initiative (or Green BRI) by examining the Chinese state‚Äôs environmental governance of extraterritorial spaces. The article transcends a focus within governmentality studies on domestic processes to reveal the relations between governance techniques and environmental subjects, including state and nonstate actors, beyond sovereign borders. Drawing on interviews, observations, and analysis of policies and reports, we identify three ways in which global environmentalities operate and are negotiated through the Green BRI. First, the Chinese state is embracing international sustainable development criteria to gain global legitimacy while seeking to export its domestic environmental governance model, making the Green BRI a dialectic policy. Second, the state is targeting and disciplining BRI participants, including Chinese financial institutions, construction companies, the renewable industry, and foreign state actors in BRI countries. Third, Chinese and BRI partner country participants‚Äô variegated subjectivities arise out of the negotiation of their own interests, Chinese state interests, and BRI host country concerns. Our analysis contributes to understanding of how China, as a rising power, engages in global environmental governance and produces extraterritorial environmental subjects.

So, too, has the popularity of the Foucauldian concept of biopolitics, which refers to political strategies of governing based on a population‚Äôs biological features. However, China‚Äôs biopolitical rationales for its growing participation in global governance (ÂÖ®ÁêÉÊ≤ªÁêÜ quanqiu zhili) beyond its borders have received less attention. This research focuses on the Arctic, a region where China does not claim territorial sovereignty but has significant involvement, to examine the Chinese state‚Äôs exertion of biopolitical control over its outbound tourist population. Drawing on a review of policy texts and media reports, complemented by observations at an Arctic conference held in China and three field visits to the Arctic in 2018‚Äì2019, we show how China‚Äôs interventions in Arctic tourism seek to transform Chinese tourists into a productive, self-disciplining population who practice and promote state logics of social and environmental responsibility. The paper contributes to the understanding of tourism governance in frontier regions with geopolitical significance, as well as the modern state‚Äôs exterritorial power over its own citizens even when they are beyond its sovereign territory.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Wang2022CQ" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">China‚Äôs Water Governmentality and the Shaping of Hydrosocial Territories: A Case of the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Mechanism</div> <div class="author">Wang, Yu Raymond,¬† <em>Liu, Xiaofeng</em>,¬†and Zhang, Wenya </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>The China Quarterly</em> 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0305741022000820" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2022-CQ-Mekong.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper examines China‚Äôs water governmentality in advancing the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC). It attends to how discourses, used as a political instrument, are framed, justified and contested in the reshaping of international hydrosocial territories. China‚Äôs official and popular discourses present the LMC as promoting multilateral politics, economic benefits and social integration, while they obscure polarizing politics, external interventions and regional conflicts. Using strategies of positive publicity first, top-down communication and mutual empathy creation, these discourses aim to deflect attention away from controversies and geopolitics in the region to construct governable hydrosocial territories. However, in a transnational context where the Chinese state cannot unilaterally control geographical imaginaries, alternative discourses depict China as a ‚Äúhydro-hegemon‚Äù that poses threats to downstream countries. The discursive dichotomy reflects multiple ontologies of water and power struggles in international river governance, bringing regional stability and sustainable development into question.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="liu2022geopolitics" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The geopolitics of knowledge communities: Situating Chinese and foreign studies of the Green Belt and Road Initiative</div> <div class="author"> <em>Liu, Xiaofeng</em>,¬†and Bennett, Mia </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Geoforum</em> 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718521003377" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Geographers are paying increasing attention to the geopolitics of knowledge production. China has attracted particular interest given the state‚Äôs professed goal of becoming a scientific power. Little research, however, has attended to the politics of scientific research relating to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Instead, a focus on the discourses and environmental impacts of infrastructure projects is paramount. Understanding the situated nature of research on the BRI, particularly within the environmental sciences, is crucial considering the Chinese state‚Äôs ambitions to become a global scientific power and a leader in green energy and climate change. We carry out a systematic review of 537 publications in Chinese and English on the Green BRI, an ostensibly more environmentally-friendly version of the initiative. We find four main research themes across the entire corpus: 1) environmental impact assessments; 2) empirical analysis of non-state actors involved in Green BRI governance; 3) identification of overseas commercial opportunities for China‚Äôs green industries; and 4) detection of policy alignment of the Chinese initiative with the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals. For each theme, we articulate the main cleavages separating the Chinese and foreign corpuses and critique the geopolitics and subjectivities embedded in environmental studies of the BRI. The two corpuses agree on: 1) the need for a greener BRI; 2) the need for more diversified governance that engages actors beyond the state; and 3) the ability for host country context and capacity to influence the BRI‚Äôs implementation. The corpuses disagree regarding: 1) the severity of the initiative‚Äôs potential impacts; 2) investors‚Äô and non-profit organizations‚Äô intentions and appropriate roles; and 3) whether China should export its norms and standards or instead adopt international ones. We attribute these cleavages to divergent implicit geopolitics embedded within the Chinese and foreign knowledge communities, which reflects broader interstate power competition. This research underscores how knowledge production is geopolitically situated even within environmental studies, which are often viewed as objective. At a time of heightening international tension, this article urges consideration of how emerging geopolitical ideas and narratives affect the practices and policies of science in rising powers.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="liu2020viral" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Viral borders: COVID-19‚Äôs effects on securitization, surveillance, and identity in Mainland China and Hong Kong</div> <div class="author"> <em>Liu, Xiaofeng</em>,¬†and Bennett, Mia M </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Dialogues in Human Geography</em> 2020 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2043820620933828" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>As COVID-19 spreads, new processes, forms, and scales of bordering practices are transcending national territorial limits.
