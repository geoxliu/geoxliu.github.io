Excited to know that I am nominated for the LEE Ka Shing Prize and HKU Foundation Award for Outstanding Research Postgraduate Student at HKU ðŸ˜„
While I understand that the awards are fiercely contested and there's no guarantee I'll win, receiving the nomination is a positive development for me after graduating from HKU for over eight months.
