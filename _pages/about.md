I am an Assistant Professor at Urban Governance and Design Thrust in the Society Hub, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Geography, National University of Singapore. My research focuses on urban governance, environmental politics, and the geopolitics of China’s international pursuit, notably the Belt and Road Initiative. With cases near and beyond China’s border, I enquire about the power entanglements of state and non-state actors in shaping discourses, producing knowledge, and regulating the implementation of international infrastructure projects and cooperation mechanisms. I try to weave domestic and extraterritorial issues to seek cross-scale explanations for the conflicts, dilemmas, and variations. My internship experiences at both governmental and non-profit agencies in China and Southeast Asia grant me the chance to observe their operation and contact potential informants. I have been publishing in Chinese and English geography journals, such as Annals of the AAG, Dialogues in Human Geography, Geoforum, Economic Geography(经济地理), etc. 

I am now establishing a Politics and Governance of Sustainable Cities lab (PGSC). The vision is to examine the sustainable development and transformation processes of global cities in addressing climate and environmental challenges, by combining quantitative analysis with qualitative case studies. This approach aims to explore the forces and obstacles at various scales, including domestic and international, and from different dimensions such as social and political, that global cities face during their development and transformation. The goal is to seek experiences and viable paths for sustainable urban development construction and transformation governance for countries in the Global South.

The lab is recruiting PhD students and Research Assistants. Welcome to apply.
